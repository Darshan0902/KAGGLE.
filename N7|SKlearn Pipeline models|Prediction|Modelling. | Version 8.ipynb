In your case, the training error is approximately 50795.86. A lower training error indicates that the model is able to capture the patterns and relationships in the training data more accurately. However, an extremely low training error might indicate overfitting, where the model has memorized the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns.\n","\n","**Testing Error**: The testing error represents how well the model performs on unseen data, i.e., the testing set. In your case, the testing error is approximately 50352.23. The testing error is typically higher than the training error because the model encounters new data during testing. The goal is to have a testing error that is close to the training error, indicating that the model can generalize well to unseen data.\n","\n","To assess the performance of your model, you can compare the testing error with other models or with a predefined threshold that determines what is an acceptable level of error for your specific problem. Additionally, you can use other evaluation metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error (MAE), or domain-specific metrics to get a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.\n","\n","Keep in mind that the evaluation of a model is highly dependent on the specific problem, dataset, and domain knowledge.

A lower training error suggests that the model is able to capture the patterns and relationships in the training data more accurately.\n","\n","Testing Error: The testing error is approximately 36045.86. This represents how well the model performs on unseen data, i.e., the testing set. The testing error is typically higher than the training error since the model encounters new data during testing. The goal is to have a testing error that is close to the training error, indicating that the model can generalize well to unseen data. .</span>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"1badf814","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.020482,"end_time":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.138457","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.117975","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <a id=\"5.3\"></a>\n","## <div style= \"font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 0px; color:WHITE; font-size:120%; text-align:left;padding:3.0px; background: brown; border-bottom: 8px solid WHITE\" >5.3 - RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION.  <br><div>\n","    "]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"id":"9092dd54","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.179936Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.179269Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.932838Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.931441Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.777317,"end_time":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.935507","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.15819","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Training error : 41454.987810152415\n","Testing error : 44544.862460904296\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor as RFR\n","\n","\n","# Using a second pipeline with the same scaling method but choosing Random forest regression instead of KNN: \n","# Also defining the no. of estimators  as \"10\" and depth as \"5\"\n","p3 = Pipeline([('Scalar',preprocess_transformers),(\"Random Forest\",RFR(n_estimators = 10 , max_depth = 7))])\n","fit_and_prnt(p3)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"17bf75c0","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.020445,"end_time":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.976751","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.956306","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <a id=\"5.3.1\"></a>\n","#### <div style= \"font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 0px; color:WHITE; font-size:120%; text-align:left;padding:3.0px; background: brown; border-bottom: 8px solid WHITE\" >RFR model prediction.  <br><div>\n","    \n","    As it can be seen here the Training and testing error we got for RFR model is :\n","        \n","          Training error : 41583.216967626926\n","          Testing error : 44229.32230923467\n","</p>\n","\n","<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n","    \n","</p>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"99f93014","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.020312,"end_time":"2023-06-28T07:51:02.017963","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-06-28T07:51:01.997651","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <a id=\"8\"></a>\n","## <div style= \"font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 0px; color:WHITE; font-size:120%; text-align:left;padding:3.0px; background: brown; border-bottom: 8px solid WHITE\" > 8 - CONCLUSION  <br><div>\n","    \n","\n","<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n"," \n","# <span style=\"color: #FF4500;\"> THE ERROR RATE IN ALL THREE ABOVE MODELS WHEN COMPARED GIVES :\n","    \n","    \n","    1.)

In your case, the training error is approximately 50795.86. A lower training error indicates that the model is able to capture the patterns and relationships in the training data more accurately. However, an extremely low training error might indicate overfitting, where the model has memorized the training data instead of learning generalizable patterns.\n","\n","**Testing Error**: The testing error represents how well the model performs on unseen data, i.e., the testing set. In your case, the testing error is approximately 50352.23. The testing error is typically higher than the training error because the model encounters new data during testing. The goal is to have a testing error that is close to the training error, indicating that the model can generalize well to unseen data.\n","\n","To assess the performance of your model, you can compare the testing error with other models or with a predefined threshold that determines what is an acceptable level of error for your specific problem. Additionally, you can use other evaluation metrics such as R-squared, mean absolute error (MAE), or domain-specific metrics to get a more comprehensive understanding of the model's performance.\n","\n","Keep in mind that the evaluation of a model is highly dependent on the specific problem, dataset, and domain knowledge.

Different distance metrics may be more suitable for different types of data. Additionally, the scalability of KNN can be a challenge as it requires comparing the new data point with all other data points in the training set.KNN is often used as a baseline or in combination with other algorithms for more complex machine learning tasks.

Evaluating the model's performance involves considering the trade-offs between different evaluation metrics and the specific requirements of your application.\n","\n","Training Error: The training error is approximately 28343.65. This indicates how well the model fits the training data. A lower training error suggests that the model is able to capture the patterns and relationships in the training data more accurately.\n","\n","Testing Error: The testing error is approximately 36045.86. This represents how well the model performs on unseen data, i.e., the testing set. The testing error is typically higher than the training error since the model encounters new data during testing. The goal is to have a testing error that is close to the training error, indicating that the model can generalize well to unseen data. .</span>\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"0866b6e0","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.019645,"end_time":"2023-07-01T12:59:52.541556","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-01T12:59:52.521911","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <a id=\"5.3\"></a>\n","## <div style= \"font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 0px; color:WHITE; font-size:120%; text-align:left;padding:3.0px; background: brown; border-bottom: 8px solid WHITE\" >5.3 - RANDOM FOREST REGRESSION.  <br><div>\n","    "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"563b7489","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.01964,"end_time":"2023-07-01T12:59:52.581572","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-01T12:59:52.561932","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["### <span style=\"color: #FF4500;\">RFR stands for Random Forest Regression, which is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for regression tasks. It is an extension of the Random Forest algorithm, which is primarily used for classification.Random Forest Regression combines the concept of ensemble learning with decision tree models to make predictions. It creates an ensemble of multiple decision trees and averages their predictions to obtain a final prediction. Each decision tree is constructed using a randomly selected subset of the training data and a subset of input features, providing diversity and reducing overfitting.Random Forest Regression offers several advantages, including:</span>\n","    \n","* It can handle a large number of input features and works well with high-dimensional data.\n","* It reduces overfitting by combining predictions from multiple trees.\n","* It provides an estimate of feature importance, allowing for feature selection.\n","* It can capture non-linear relationships between features and target variables.\n","    \n","    \n","### <span style=\"color: #FF4500;\">However, Random Forest Regression also has some limitations, such as:</span>\n","\n","* It can be computationally expensive, especially when dealing with a large number of trees or complex datasets.\n","* It may not perform well when there are strong linear relationships between features and target variables.\n","\n","### <span style=\"color: #FF4500;\">Overall, Random Forest Regression is a powerful algorithm that is widely used in regression tasks, particularly when dealing with complex and non-linear relationships</span>\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":29,"id":"3c728b97","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-07-01T12:59:52.623075Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-07-01T12:59:52.622467Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-07-01T12:59:53.399354Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-07-01T12:59:53.397817Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.800852,"end_time":"2023-07-01T12:59:53.402289","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-01T12:59:52.601437","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Training error : 41227.840680365334\n","Testing error : 44035.126452511686\n"]}],"source":["from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor as RFR\n","\n","\n","# Using a second pipeline with the same scaling method but choosing Random forest regression instead of KNN: \n","# Also defining the no. of estimators  as \"10\" and depth as \"5\"\n","p3 = Pipeline([('Scalar',preprocess_transformers),(\"Random Forest\",RFR(n_estimators = 10 , max_depth = 7))])\n","fit_and_prnt(p3)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"6ef6b225","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.019851,"end_time":"2023-07-01T12:59:53.442367","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-01T12:59:53.422516","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <a id=\"5.3.1\"></a>\n","#### <div style= \"font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 0px; color:WHITE; font-size:120%; text-align:left;padding:3.0px; background: brown; border-bottom: 8px solid WHITE\" >RFR model prediction.  <br><div>\n","    As it can be seen here the Training and testing error we got for RFR model is :\n","        \n","          Training error : 41583.216967626926\n","          Testing error : 44229.32230923467\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"f0b29954","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.019817,"end_time":"2023-07-01T12:59:53.482776","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-07-01T12:59:53.462959","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["# <a id=\"8\"></a>\n","## <div style= \"font-family: Times New Roman; font-weight:bold; letter-spacing: 0px; color:WHITE; font-size:120%; text-align:left;padding:3.0px; background: brown; border-bottom: 8px solid WHITE\" > 8 - CONCLUSION  <br><div>\n","    \n","\n","<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n"," \n","# <span style=\"color: #FF4500;\"> THE ERROR RATE IN ALL THREE ABOVE MODELS WHEN COMPARED GIVES :\n","    \n","    \n","    1.)

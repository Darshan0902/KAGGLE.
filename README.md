# N1 | Cracking the Code of Accuracy| Unveiling MSE , MAE , RMSE :

 
 https://www.kaggle.com/code/darshanprabhu09/mse-mae-rmse-for-the-housing-dataset

I am here to announce and ask for your reviews as I share my First and foremost implementation of Metrics like "Root mean Square error (RMSE)" , "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) " , "Mean Squared Error (MSE)" in Python . I have used the dataset of 5000 peoples whose housing were located also I am gonna share about the statistical as well as the Theory knowledge I gained from this :

RMSE (Root mean squared error)
```
Root mean square error or root mean square deviation is one of the most commonly used measures 
for evaluating the quality of predictions. It shows how far predictions fall from measured
true values using Euclidean distance.

To compute RMSE, calculate the residual (difference between prediction and truth) for each
data point, compute the norm of residual for each data point, compute the mean of residuals 
and take the square root of that mean.RMSE is commonly used in supervised learning
applications,as RMSE uses and needs true measurements at each predicted data point.

Root mean square error can be expressed as where N is the number of data points, y(i) 
is the i-th measurement, and y ̂(i) .Is its corresponding prediction.

Note: RMSE is NOT scale invariant and hence comparison of models using this 
measure is affected by the scale of the data. For this reason, RMSE is
commonly used over standardized data.
```
Mean Absolute Error (MAE):
```
In the context of machine learning, absolute error refers to the magnitude
of difference between the prediction of an observation and the true value 
of that observation. MAE takes the average of absolute errors for a group 
of predictions and observations as a measurement of the magnitude of 
errors for the entire group. MAE can also be referred as L1 
(loss function).

```
Mean Squared Error (MSE) :
```
:

The average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual
value. MSE is a risk function, corresponding to the expected value of the 
squared error loss. The fact that MSE is almost always strictly positive 
(and not zero) is because of randomness or because the estimator does not
account for information that could produce a more accurate estimate.
```

# N2 |Titans in graphs |Exploring the Time Series : 

https://www.kaggle.com/code/darshanprabhu09/n2-titans-in-graphs-exploring-the-time-series/notebook

Time series analysis is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time. In time series analysis, analysts record data points at consistent intervals over a set period of time 
rather than just recording the data points intermittently or randomly. However, this type of analysis is not merely the act of collecting data over time. 

What sets time series data apart from other data is that the analysis can show how variables change over time. In other words, time is a crucial variable because it shows how the data adjusts over the course of the 
data points as well as the final results. It provides an additional source of information and a set order of dependencies between the data. 

Time series analysis typically requires a large number of data points to ensure consistency and reliability. An extensive data set ensures you have a representative sample size and that analysis can cut through noisy 
data. It also ensures that any trends or patterns discovered are not outliers and can account for seasonal variance. Additionally, time series data can be used for forecasting—predicting future data based on historical data.

Introduction
The California Housing Price Prediction project aims to develop machine learning models that can predict housing prices in different neighborhoods of California. The project utilizes a dataset containing various attributes such as location coordinates, housing median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population, households, median income, median house value, and ocean proximity. By analyzing the data and building predictive models, we can gain insights into the factors that affect housing prices and create accurate price predictions.

Data Description
The dataset used in this project provides information on housing attributes in different neighborhoods of California. Here is a summary of the dataset's features:

Longitude: The longitude coordinates of the housing location.
Latitude: The latitude coordinates of the housing location.
Housing Median Age: The median age of houses in a specific neighborhood.
Total Rooms: The total number of rooms in a housing unit.
Total Bedrooms: The total number of bedrooms in a housing unit.
Population: The population count in a specific neighborhood.
Households: The number of households in a specific neighborhood.
Median Income: The median income of households in a specific neighborhood.
Median House Value: The median value of houses in a specific neighborhood.
Ocean Proximity: The proximity of a housing unit to the ocean.
Importing Libraries
To perform data analysis and build machine learning models, several Python libraries are imported, including NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn (sklearn). These libraries provide various functions and tools for data manipulation, analysis, and model building.

Data Collection & Preparation
The dataset used in this project is collected from the California Housing dataset. The data is divided into a training set and a testing set. The necessary data preprocessing steps, such as data cleaning and feature scaling, are performed to prepare the data for analysis and model building.

Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is conducted to gain insights and understand the dataset better. This includes analyzing both the training and testing data, examining descriptive statistics, visualizing the data through plots and charts, and checking for missing values. EDA helps in understanding the distribution of variables, identifying patterns, and identifying any data issues that need to be addressed.

5.1. Training Data
The training data is analyzed and visualized to understand the distribution and relationships between different features. Summary statistics are calculated, and visualizations such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices are created to explore the data.

5.2. Testing Data
Similar to the training data, the testing data is also analyzed and visualized to gain insights into the dataset. The distribution and relationships between features are examined using summary statistics, histograms, scatter plots, and other relevant visualizations.

5.3. Conversion to Numpy Array
To prepare the data for model training and evaluation, the datasets are converted into Numpy arrays. The features and target variables are separated, and the necessary transformations are applied to ensure compatibility with the machine learning models.

5.4. Scaling
To ensure that the features are on a similar scale and to improve model performance, feature scaling techniques such as StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler are applied. These techniques normalize the features to have zero mean and unit variance or scale them to a specific range, respectively.

Model Building
In this section, three machine learning models are built to predict housing prices: Linear Regression, KNN Regression, and Random Forest Regression. Each model is briefly described, and the steps involved in training and evaluating the models are outlined.
6.1. Linear Regression
6.1.1. Model Overview
Linear Regression is a statistical modeling technique used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. It aims to find the best-fitting linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable. In the context of machine learning, linear regression is often used as a predictive model to estimate or predict the value of a continuous target variable based on input features.

6.1.2. Training and Evaluation
The Linear Regression model is trained using the training data, and the model's performance is evaluated using evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error. The training and testing errors are calculated, providing insights into how well the model fits the training data and generalizes to unseen data.

6.2. KNN Model (K-Nearest Neighbors)
6.2.1. Model Overview
KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) is a non-parametric machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It makes predictions based on the similarity of input data points to their k nearest neighbors. In the case of regression, the predicted value is the average of the values of the k nearest neighbors.

6.2.2. Training and Evaluation
The KNN model is trained using the training data, and the model's performance is evaluated using evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error. The optimal value of k is determined through cross-validation, and the model's performance is assessed on the testing data.

6.3. Random Forest Regression
6.3.1. Model Overview
Random Forest Regression is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to create a more robust and accurate predictive model. Each tree in the random forest is trained on a random subset of the training data and uses a random subset of features for splitting decisions. The final prediction is obtained by averaging the predictions of all the individual trees.

6.3.2. Training and Evaluation
The Random Forest Regression model is trained using the training data, and the model's performance is evaluated using evaluation metrics such as mean absolute error. The number of trees in the random forest and other hyperparameters are tuned to optimize the model's performance. The trained model is then evaluated on the testing data.

Conclusion
In this project, we developed machine learning models to predict housing prices in different neighborhoods of California. By analyzing the dataset and building predictive models, we gained insights into the factors that affect housing prices. The models, including Linear Regression, KNN Regression, and Random Forest Regression, were trained and evaluated on the dataset, providing accurate price predictions. The project demonstrates the application of machine learning in real estate and can be used as a basis for further research and analysis.

Future Improvements
While the developed models provide accurate predictions, there are several areas for future improvement. These include:

Collecting additional data to improve the model's accuracy and generalization.
Exploring more advanced machine learning algorithms to compare and enhance the predictive performance.
Conducting feature engineering to create new meaningful features that canbetter capture the relationship between housing attributes and prices.
Incorporating domain knowledge and external data sources to enrich the dataset and improve the model's predictive power.
Fine-tuning the hyperparameters of the models to further optimize their performance.
Implementing ensemble methods to combine the predictions of multiple models for improved accuracy and robustness.
Deploying the models in a production environment, such as a web application, to provide real-time housing price predictions and assist users in decision-making.

 my work and share your reviews or some suggestions meant to be added on the same .
 
 
 About the dataset : 
 
 The given data appears to be a tabular representation with several columns. Here is a description of each column:

**MolLogP**: This column represents the calculated logarithm of the partition coefficient (LogP) for the chemical compounds. LogP is a measure of the compound's lipophilicity or hydrophobicity, indicating its tendency to dissolve in oil or water.

**MolWt**: This column represents the molecular weight of the compounds. Molecular weight is the sum of the atomic weights of all atoms in a molecule and is an important property in determining the physical and chemical characteristics of a compound.

**NumRotatableBonds**: This column indicates the number of rotatable bonds in the chemical compounds. Rotatable bonds refer to single bonds that can rotate freely without breaking, and they play a role in the compound's flexibility and conformational changes.

**AromaticProportion**: This column represents the proportion of aromatic atoms present in the compounds. Aromaticity is a property associated with compounds containing conjugated ring systems, such as benzene rings.

**logS**: This column represents the logarithm of the solubility values for the compounds. Solubility is a measure of how well a compound dissolves in a given solvent.

**Label**: This column appears to provide ranges or intervals for the solubility values (logS) or molecular weights (MolWt) in the dataset.

**Count**: This column represents the count or frequency of compounds falling within the respective range or interval specified by the label.



# N9|Feature Engineering|PCA|DIMENSION-REDUCTION : 

https://www.kaggle.com/code/darshanprabhu09/n9-feature-engineering-pca-dimension-reduction


Feature engineering is the process where one can make changes in their particular data to be used , By reducing or removing the unwanted data in their dataset this process is sometimes also know as "DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION". 
 Dimensionality reduction is used to reduce the number of dimensions or features in a particular dataframe so as a result our model may not have to face OVERFITTING of data . There contains various compononents for feature 
 engineering they are as follows : 


1. Principal component analysis (PCA) :
```
      Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large datasets containing a high
      number of dimensions/features per observation, increasing the interpretability of data while preserving
      the maximum amount of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data.


     PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. This is accomplished by 
     linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate system where (most of) the variation in the data 
     can be described with fewer dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal
     components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually identify clusters of closely
     related data points. Principal component analysis has applications in many fields such as population 
     genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science.
```


2. Dimensionality Reduction :

```
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features in a dataset while retaining
as much of the important information as possible. In other words, it is a process of transforming 
high-dimensional data into a lower-dimensional space that still preserves the essence of the original data.

In machine learning, high-dimensional data refers to data with a large number of features or variables.
The curse of dimensionality is a common problem in machine learning, where the performance of the 
model deteriorates as the number of features increases. This is because the complexity of the model 
increases with the number of features, and it becomes more difficult to find a good solution. In 
addition, high-dimensional data can also lead to overfitting, where the model fits the training
data too closely and does not generalize well to new data.

Dimensionality reduction can help to mitigate these problems by reducing the complexity of the model and 
improving its generalization performance. There are two main approaches to dimensionality reduction:
feature selection and feature extraction.

```

3. Feature Selection:

```
Feature selection involves selecting a subset of the original features that are most relevant to the
problem at hand. The goal is to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most 
important features. There are several methods for feature selection, including filter methods,
wrapper methods, and embedded methods. Filter methods rank the features based on their relevance 
to the target variable, wrapper methods use the model performance as the criteria for selecting 
features, and embedded methods combine feature selection with the model training process.

```


4. Feature Extraction:

```
Feature extraction involves creating new features by combining or transforming the original 
features. The goal is to create a set of features that captures the essence of the original 
data in a lower-dimensional space. There are several methods for feature extraction, including 
principal component analysis (PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and t-distributed 
stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE). PCA is a popular technique that projects the original
features onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much of the variance as possible.

```

5. Principal Component Analysis

```
This method was introduced by Karl Pearson. It works on the condition that while the data
in a higher dimensional space is mapped to data in a lower dimension space, the variance 
of the data in the lower dimensional space should be maximum.



It involves the following steps:

Construct the covariance matrix of the data.
Compute the eigenvectors of this matrix.
Eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are used to reconstruct a large
fraction of variance of the original data.Hence, we are left with a lesser number of 
eigenvectors, and there might have been some data loss in the process. But, the most 
important variances should be retained by the remaining eigenvectors.

24 - Conclusion
In this analysis, we explored various aspects of the student alcohol consumption dataset. We started by importing the necessary libraries and loading the data. Then, we performed frequency distribution analysis for categorical columns and correlation analysis for numerical columns. We also conducted gender-based analysis and visualized the data using count plots, box plots, and violin plots. Additionally, we calculated summary statistics, created a correlation heatmap, and examined the distribution of age. Finally, we applied logistic regression and decision tree classification models to predict student failures.

Overall, this analysis provides insights into the factors that may influence student alcohol consumption and academic performance. Further analysis and modeling can be conducted to explore these relationships in more detail.

Feature engineering is the process where one can make changes in their particular data to be used , By reducing or removing the unwanted data in their dataset this process is sometimes also know as "DIMENSIONALITY REDUCTION". 
 Dimensionality reduction is used to reduce the number of dimensions or features in a particular dataframe so as a result our model may not have to face OVERFITTING of data . There contains various compononents for feature 
 engineering they are as follows : 


1. Principal component analysis (PCA) :
```
      Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large 
      datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, 
      increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount 
      of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data.


     PCA is a statistical technique for reducing the dimensionality of a dataset. 
     This is accomplished by linearly transforming the data into a new coordinate 
     system where (most of) the variation in the data can be described with fewer 
     dimensions than the initial data. Many studies use the first two principal
     components in order to plot the data in two dimensions and to visually 
     identify clusters of closely related data points. Principal component
     analysis has applications in many fields such as population 
     genetics, microbiome studies, and atmospheric science.
     
```

2. Dimensionality Reduction :

```
Dimensionality reduction is a technique used to reduce the number of features
in a dataset while retaining as much of the important information as possible. 
In other words, it is a process of transforming high-dimensional data into a
lower-dimensional space that still preserves the 
essence of the original data.

In machine learning, high-dimensional data refers to data with a large number 
of features or variables. The curse of dimensionality is a common problem in
machine learning, where the performance of the model deteriorates as the 
number of features increases. This is because the complexity of the model 
increases with the number of features, and it becomes more difficult to find 
a good solution. In addition, high-dimensional datacan also lead to 
overfitting, where the model fits the training data too closely 
and does not generalize well to new data.

Dimensionality reduction can help to mitigate these problems by reducing 
the complexity of the model and improving its generalization performance. 
There are two main approaches to dimensionality reduction: feature 
selection and feature extraction.

```

3. Feature Selection:

```
Feature selection involves selecting a subset of the original features
that are most relevant to the problem at hand. The goal is to reduce
the dimensionality of the dataset while retaining the most important
features. There are several methods for feature selection, including
filter methods, wrapper methods, and embedded methods. Filter methods
rank the features based on their relevance to the target variable, 
wrapper methods use the model performance as the criteria for selecting 
features, and embedded methods combine feature selection with the model
training process.

```



4. Feature Extraction:

```
Feature extraction involves creating new features by combining or transforming
the original features. The goal is to create a set of features that captures 
the essence of the original data in a lower-dimensional space. There are 
several methods for feature extraction, including principal component analysis 
(PCA), linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and t-distributed stochastic neighbor 
embedding (t-SNE). PCA is a popular technique that projects the original
features onto a lower-dimensional space while preserving as much of the 
variance as possible.

```

5. Principal Component Analysis

```
This method was introduced by Karl Pearson. It works on the condition
that while the data in a higher dimensional space is mapped to data in 
a lower dimension space, the variance of the data in the lower 
dimensional space should be maximum.

 Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular technique for analyzing large 
 datasets containing a high number of dimensions/features per observation, 
 increasing the interpretability of data while preserving the maximum amount 
 of information, and enabling the visualization of multidimensional data.
 
```

It involves the following steps:

```
-Construct the covariance matrix of the data.
-Compute the eigenvectors of this matrix.
-Eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues are used to 
-reconstruct a large fraction of variance of the original data.Hence, 
-we are left with a lesser number of eigenvectors, and there might
-have been some data loss in the process. But, the most 
-important variances should be retained by the remaining eigenvectors.
```

This project demonstrates image classification of cats and dogs using the Xception model. The code performs the following steps:

1. Data Preparation:
   - Creates a directory structure for storing the training, validation, and test datasets.
   - Moves the original training and test images to their respective directories.
   - Splits the test dataset into validation and test subsets.

2. Model Building:
   - Uses the Xception model for transfer learning.
   - Freezes the layers of the base model.
   - Adds a Flatten layer and a Dense layer with softmax activation for classification.

3. Data Augmentation and Preprocessing:
   - Uses the ImageDataGenerator class to generate augmented images for training data.
   - Preprocesses the input images using the Xception-specific preprocess_input function.

4. Training and Saving the Model:
   - Fits the training data to the model with a specified number of epochs.
   - Adds a checkpoint to save the best model based on validation accuracy.
   - Saves the trained model and creates a runtime model for inference.

5. Prediction and Evaluation:
   - Uses the saved runtime model to make predictions on the test dataset.
   - Converts the predicted values into cat and dog classes.
   - Evaluates the accuracy of the model by comparing the predicted labels with the true labels.

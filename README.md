I am here to announce and ask for your reviews as I share my First and foremost implementation of Metrics like "Root mean Square error (RMSE)" , "Mean Absolute Error (MAE) " , "Mean Squared Error (MSE)" in Python . I have used the dataset of 5000 peoples whose housing were located also I am gonna share about the statistical as well as the Theory knowledge I gained from this :

RMSE (Root mean squared error)
```
Root mean square error or root mean square deviation is one of the most commonly used measures for evaluating the quality of predictions. It shows how far predictions fall from measured true values using Euclidean distance.

To compute RMSE, calculate the residual (difference between prediction and truth) for each data point, compute the norm of residual for each data point, compute the mean of residuals and take the square root of that mean. RMSE is commonly used in supervised learning applications, as RMSE uses and needs true measurements at each predicted data point.

Root mean square error can be expressed as where N is the number of data points, y(i) is the i-th measurement, and y ̂(i) is its corresponding prediction.

Note: RMSE is NOT scale invariant and hence comparison of models using this measure is affected by the scale of the data. For this reason, RMSE is commonly used over standardized data.
```
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
:
```
In the context of machine learning, absolute error refers to the magnitude of difference between the prediction of an observation and the true value of that observation. MAE takes the average of absolute errors for a group of predictions and observations as a measurement of the magnitude of errors for the entire group. MAE can also be referred as L1 loss function.
```
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
```
:

The average squared difference between the estimated values and the actual value. MSE is a risk function, corresponding to the expected value of the squared error loss. The fact that MSE is almost always strictly positive (and not zero) is because of randomness or because the estimator does not account for information that could produce a more accurate estimate.

Time series analysis is a specific way of analyzing a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time. In time series analysis, analysts record data points at consistent intervals over a set period of time rather than just recording the data points intermittently or randomly. However, this type of analysis is not merely the act of collecting data over time. 

What sets time series data apart from other data is that the analysis can show how variables change over time. In other words, time is a crucial variable because it shows how the data adjusts over the course of the data points as well as the final results. It provides an additional source of information and a set order of dependencies between the data. 

Time series analysis typically requires a large number of data points to ensure consistency and reliability. An extensive data set ensures you have a representative sample size and that analysis can cut through noisy data. It also ensures that any trends or patterns discovered are not outliers and can account for seasonal variance. Additionally, time series data can be used for forecasting—predicting future data based on historical data.

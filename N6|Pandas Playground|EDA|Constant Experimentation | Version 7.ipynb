It divides a continuous variable into discrete intervals (or bins) based on sample quantiles. The goal of pd.qcut() is to ensure that each bin contains approximately an equal number of data points.This code will divide the data Series into 5 equal-sized bins based on quantiles and assign a categorical label to each data point indicating the bin it belongs to. The resulting categories will be a Categorical object representing the discretized data."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":49,"id":"f96932f4","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2023-06-30T19:55:54.369866Z","iopub.status.busy":"2023-06-30T19:55:54.369472Z","iopub.status.idle":"2023-06-30T19:55:54.383709Z","shell.execute_reply":"2023-06-30T19:55:54.382322Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.055272,"end_time":"2023-06-30T19:55:54.386337","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-06-30T19:55:54.331065","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["0     (0.00594, 0.204]\n","1       (0.825, 0.988]\n","2     (0.00594, 0.204]\n","3       (0.385, 0.626]\n","4     (0.00594, 0.204]\n","            ...       \n","95      (0.385, 0.626]\n","96      (0.204, 0.385]\n","97    (0.00594, 0.204]\n","98      (0.825, 0.988]\n","99      (0.385, 0.626]\n","Length: 100, dtype: category\n","Categories (5, interval[float64, right]): [(0.00594, 0.204] < (0.204, 0.385] < (0.385, 0.626] < (0.626, 0.825] < (0.825, 0.988]]\n"]}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","\n","data = pd.Series(np.random.rand(100))\n","categories = pd.qcut(data, q=5)\n","print(categories)\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"bf6fb07d","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.035861,"end_time":"2023-06-30T19:55:54.458949","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-06-30T19:55:54.423088","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["   \n","## <span style=\"color: #FF4500;\"> THANK YOU :\n","\n","\n","\n","<p style=\"padding: 10px; background-color: #000000; margin: 0; color: ORANGE; font-family: New Times Roman; font-size: 135%; text-align: center; border-radius: 5px; overflow: hidden; font-weight: 500;\">\n","THANK YOU . \n","</p>\n","\n","<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n","    <!-- Content related to the bar chart can be added here -->\n","</p>\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","## <span style=\"color: #FF4450;\"> I hope you all learnt something or atleast it was a revision for most of you users , I would love your opinions on this let me know , If I am missing out something in this notebook , And do upvote as it keeps me motivated and helps me to perform and provide better.</span>\n","## <span style=\"color: #FF4450;\"> THANKING YOU IN ANTICIPATON;"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"cb8e1068","metadata":{"papermill":{"duration":0.036063,"end_time":"2023-06-30T19:55:54.531365","exception":false,"start_time":"2023-06-30T19:55:54.495302","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"source":["![Alt Text](https://media.giphy.com/media/9V8You0A1G64JmiBUi/giphy.gif)\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.10"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":24.387527,"end_time":"2023-06-30T19:55:55.490474","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2023-06-30T19:55:31.102947","version":"2.4.0"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
